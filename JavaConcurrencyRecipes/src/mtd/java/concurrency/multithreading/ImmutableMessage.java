/**
 * An example of how to implement an immutable class for multi-threading design
 * Rules:
 * 	- All fields should be final and private.
 * 	- There should be not setter methods.
 *  - The class itself should be declared final in order to prevent subclasses to violate the principle
 *     of immutability.
 *  - If fields are not of a primitive type but a reference to another object:
 *  	- There should not be a getter method that exposes the reference directly to the caller.
 *  	- Donâ€™t change the referenced objects (or at least changing these references is not visible 
 *  	   to clients of the object).
